- tile class is the abstract base class
   - empty, head, body, food

- snake moves in 1 direction unless told otherwise
   -when calling move, add parameter to function that tells it which way to move
      -use switch in definition of move function to make it easier

- how to get body to move?
   -start at head (number 1), each body segment has a value (head is 1, next segment is 2, ... , tail is n)
   - move each segment to the spot that has a higher value

   -also could keep a vector of body segments
      -move just takes the coordinates of the next index in the vector 


- EXTRAS
   - if the food sits for too long then it will get poisoned, snake will lose health if he eats it
   - food could randomly be spawned as a bomb
      -sets adjacent tiles to a different color for a period of time
      -snake will die if it gets hit with the bomb
